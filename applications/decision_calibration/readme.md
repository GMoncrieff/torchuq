## Decision Calibration

This repo contains code to reproduce the results in "Calibrating Probabilities to Decisions". 

We have in-built most algorithms in the torchuq repo, so reproducing the experimental results only takes a few lines. 


## Running instructions

To run the code simply use jupyter to run `ham10000.ipynb` or `imagenet.ipynb`. The notebooks are contain the instructions for running themselves.
