TorchUQ is your one-stop solution for uncertainty quantification. At its core, TorchUQ supports various representations of uncertainty (including probability, particle/ensemble, conformal sets, etc), and 1. converts between different representations of uncertainty 2. adjusts any uncertainty representation so it becomes calibrated/valid 3. evaluates and visualizes the quality of uncertainty quantification. TorchUQ is built on pytorch, and supports auto-differentiation for most of its functions. Support for numpy interface to come.
